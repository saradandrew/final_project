 # Technologies Used

 ## Data Cleaning and Analysis

Python and Pandas will be used to perform any necessary data cleaning and all analysis.

 ## Database Storage

We will use PostgreSQL as our database.

 ## Machine Learning

We'll be using the SciKit-Learn Library for our Linear Regression Machine Learning Model and Matplotlib to display the plotted data. Our training and testing setup will be a 50/50 split.

 ## Dashboard
 
We will be using Matplotlib to display our data. Additional visuals will be done using Tableau. The full project will be hosted on GitHub Pages.
