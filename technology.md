 # Technologies Used

 ## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Python and Pandas will be used to perform any necessary data cleaning and all analysis. We will also use R Studio to tie in statistical analysis.

 ## Database Storage
We will use PostgreSQL as our database.

 ## Machine Learning
We'll be using the SciKit-Learn Library for our Linear Regression Machine Learning Model and Matplotlib to display the plotted data. Our training and testing setup will be a 75/25 split.

 ## Dashboard
We will be using hvplot and Matplotlib to display our data. Additional visuals will be done using Tableau. The full project will be hosted on GitHub Pages.
