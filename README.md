# Final Project

## Communication Protocols
Slack: We will be using Slack as our group messaging platform to ask questions and share findings and resources.

GitHub: We'll use GitHub to document updates and track individual contributions by uploading into our designated branches.

Zoom: Our group will be utilizing class Zoom time to further brainstorm and ask for assistance if we run into any walls while completing our individual tasks.

## Role for Segment 1
I will be taking on the "square" role for this first segment.
