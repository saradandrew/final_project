## Team Information

- Topic
  - Housing Prices vs Population
- Reason the topic was selected
  - Curiosity about the housing boom that seemed to occur during the pandemic, specifically in popular states such as California, Florida, New York, Texas, and then our home state of Tennessee.
- Description of the source of data
  - Kaggle Data Sets, CSV format
- Questions the team hopes to answer with the data
  - Was there an effect on housing prices and populations due to the covid-19 pandemic?
  - Does population have an impact on housing prices in 2025? (ML prediction)
  - More possible questions for tableau story to come as data is played with more


## First Segment ("X Role")

A rough list of what technologies we plan to use for this project, with the flexibility to adjust and change as we progess through the project.

#### Data Cleaning and Analysis

- Python
- Pandas
- R Studio

#### Database Storage

- PostgreSQL

#### Machine Learning

- SciKit-Learn Library
  - Linear Regression Machine Learning Model
  - Matplotlib to display the plotted data
  - Training/Testing setup will be a 75/25 split

#### Dashboard

- hvplot
- Matplotlib
- Tableau
- GitHub Pages
    
#### Additional Tasks Done for Segment 1

- Data preprocessing has been done (cleaned, encoded, scaled data, added preliminary sql connection coding)
  - Each TM will need to create a config.py to run the full code on their individual computers
- An index.html rough outline has been created to get us an idea of how our data will be displayed for the final presentation
  - Google Slides & Interactive Tableau Dashboard will be embedded here
- Next steps discussed by the team will be to import tables into PostgreSQL to join population data into housing prices data to use with our ML model
  - Possibly splitting the data into separate states for separate ML models
