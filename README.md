# Final Project

## First Segment (Circle Role)
During the first segment of the project , the circle role is in charge of the mockup database. For our database, we will be using PostgreSQL by use of pgAdmin. The image below, ERD, represents the tables of data that are uploaded onto the database in Postgres. It was a helpful reference while importing data into the database. 

Tables Uploaded: 
1. Total Dataset
2. Race/Ethnicity vs. score results
3. Parental Education vs. score results
4. Lunch Status vs. score results
5. Test preparation vs. score results
