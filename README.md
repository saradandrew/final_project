# Final Project

## Segment 1: Square Role
Communication Protocols

Slack: We will be using Slack as our group messaging platform to ask questions and share findings and resources.

GitHub: We'll use GitHub to document updates and track individual contributions by uploading into our designated branches.

Zoom: Our group will be utilizing class Zoom time to further brainstorm and ask for assistance if we run into any walls while completing our individual tasks.

## Segment 2: Cirlce Role
For this segment, I am taking on the circle role. Tasks for this role consist of peer reviewing the code to ensure it is running smoothly and presenting three images to use in the presentation and dashboard. In order to do so, I will create a new branch. This branch will be named "prandvizzes."
