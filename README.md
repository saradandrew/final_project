# Final Project

## First Segment (Circle Role)
During the first segment of the project , the circle role is in charge of the mockup database. For our database, we will be using PostgreSQL by use of pgAdmin. The image below, ERD, represents the tables of data that are uploaded onto the database in Postgres. It was a helpful reference while importing data into the database.

All tables include data from 2019-2021 for the following states: California, Florida, New York, Tennessee, & Texas.

Tables Uploaded: 
1. State Population 2019-2021
2. Zillow Home Value Index
