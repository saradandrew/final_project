# Final Project

## Segment 1: Square Role
Communication Protocols

Slack: We will be using Slack as our group messaging platform to ask questions and share findings and resources.

GitHub: We'll use GitHub to document updates and track individual contributions by uploading into our designated branches.

Zoom: Our group will be utilizing class Zoom time to further brainstorm and ask for assistance if we run into any walls while completing our individual tasks.

## Segment 2: Cirlce Role
For this segment, I am taking on the circle role. Tasks for this role consist of peer reviewing the code to ensure it is running smoothly and presenting three images to use in the presentation and dashboard. In order to do so, I will create a new branch. This branch will be named "prandvizzes."

In our MockUp.ipynb file, we have constructed a dataframe titled population_df from the us_pop_by_state.csv file. Here is the dataframe after formatting and selecting only information for California, Florida, New York, Tennesse, and Texas.

Based off this information, we have constructed a simple bar chart on Tableau that shows population by percentage. The bar chart includes a filter so that only the five states showed are presented at first. However, the interactive part of this graph is that you can choose any other state for comparison. The graph is shown below.
