## Team Information

- Topic
  - Housing Prices vs Population
- Reason the topic was selected
  - Curiosity about the housing boom that seemed to occur during the pandemic, specifically in the highly populated state of New York.
- Description of the source of data
  - Kaggle Data Sets, CSV format
- Questions the team hopes to answer with the data
  - Was there an effect on housing prices and populations due to the covid-19 pandemic?
  - Does the number of bedrooms matter? What about bathrooms? Square footage? Size of the acre lot?
  - Does population have an impact on housing prices? (Machine-Learning Linear Regression Model  prediction)


## First Segment 

#### Samantha ("X Role" - Presentation/Data Preprocessing)

- Technologies were discussed amongst the group and typed up in a markdown format. It will be updated if needed as we progess through the project.
- Data preprocessing has been done (cleaned, encoded, scaled data, added preliminary sql connection coding)
  - Each TM will need to create a config.py to run the full code on their individual computers
- An index.html rough outline has been created to get us an idea of how our data will be displayed for the final presentation
  - Google Slides & Interactive Tableau Dashboard will be embedded here
- Next steps discussed by the team will be to import tables into PostgreSQL to join population data into housing prices data to use with our ML model
  - Possibly splitting the data into separate states for separate ML models

## Second Segment 

#### Samantha ("X Role" - Presentation: Google Slides, Tableau)

- Our dataset shifted again, as our machine learning helped us determine that we needed different features to predict what we wanted. So I updated our preprocessing of the data to account for this.
  - Old dataset was removed
  - New dataset (housing_df) was brought in
    - All states except New York & Tennessee were dropped
    - Null values were dropped (which ended up taking Tennessee out of the running)
  - Finalized connection to send all cleaned tables to SQL for Carissa to perform the joins to add population to our other tables
