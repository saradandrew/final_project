# Final Project

## Segment 1: Square Role
Communication Protocols

Slack: We will be using Slack as our group messaging platform to ask questions and share findings and resources.

GitHub: We'll use GitHub to document updates and track individual contributions by uploading into our designated branches.

Zoom: Our group will be utilizing class Zoom time to further brainstorm and ask for assistance if we run into any walls while completing our individual tasks.

## Segment 2: Cirlce Role
For this segment, I am taking on the circle role. The task for this role consists of presenting three images to use in the presentation and dashboard. I have used Tableau to create graphs that analyze average house size, acre lot, and price in each city for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. These graphs are meant to give an idea of what the typical house size, acre lot, and price is by each city and which cities have larger houses and higher house prices.
