# Final Project

## Communication Protocols
Slack: We will be using Slack as our group messaging platform to ask questions and share findings and resources.

GitHub: We'll use GitHub to document updates and track individual contributions by uploading into our designated branches.

Zoom: Our group will be utilizing class Zoom time to further brainstorm and ask for assistance if we run into any walls while completing our individual tasks.

## Role for Segment 1
I will be taking on the "square" role for this first segment.

## Presentation Information
The topic of our presentation is student performance in exams. The dataset, which we have obtained from Kaggle, consists of marks secured by students in various subjects.

We selected this topic in order to examine whether certain factors determined how students perform on exams, and if so, what are these determining factors and how influential are they to performance?

Our dataset consists of 1,000 rows and eight columns of data. Three of the eight columns consist of grades recieved by students while the remaining five columns contain demographic information and test preparation participation that may be influential in the overall grades receieved.

Questions we hope to answer with this data include:
- Does gender have any effect on grades?
- Does parental level of education have any effect on grades?
- Does income have any effect on grades? (lunch)
- Does taking a test preparation course have any effect on grades?
