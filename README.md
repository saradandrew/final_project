Final Project

## Project Method

Our data for this project was found on Kaggle.com. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/students-performance-in-exams
This is a dataset of 1000 students covering test scores in math, reading, and writing. The students are further classified by ethnicity, parental education levels, reduced vs. standard lunch, and if the student has completed a test prep course or not. 
The plan for using this data is to provide valuations to the columns gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, and test prep course. These will be used with the test scores provided and ran through a linear regression model to see what factors, if any, have the largest impact on a studentâ€™s ability to pass a college acceptance exam. 
To accomplish this, the non-integer datatypes will be given numerical values and entered into the model.
The model will look at the statistical significance of each variable and we will be training the model to better fit the data to help students best know what affects their likelihood to pass the test. Due to the nature of our data, supervised machine learning seems to be the better method to use. 
A mock up model has been created with the unedited data. Due to it not being edited yet, the visualization is off and the model is not fitting, but this will be corrected well before submitting for final presentations.
